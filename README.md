# Plants_DB
I enjoy gardening and have far too many plants and trees to easily remember what specific care any one of them needs.  
The purpose of this app is to store info on different plant species and varieties.
Eventual functionality will send me notifications for important weather events (ie: temperatures dropping below 32 degrees) and care reminders.

Additional goals include re-familiarizing myself with PostgreSQL and learning more about using Docker for application development.
